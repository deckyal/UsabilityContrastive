# Usability Contrastive
The Usability  Analysis For Contrastive Website Analysis

In the context of a RP of the University of Stuttgart, the study "The usability analysis for contrastive website analysis" was accomplished.
The goal of the study was to use eye tracking and emotion recognition to better determine the usability of different websites.

In the repository you can have a look at the two programs that were used for the project.

1. Program that recorded the faces of the participants via webcam.
2. Emotion recognition program. 
   The program receives as input an image with a face. Based on this image, the program gives a prediction about the emotions that the person depicted in the image has.
